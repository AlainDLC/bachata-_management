This is a web-based application that allows administrators to create and manage dance courses, while providing customers the ability to browse, purchase, and access course videos. The system includes a user-friendly admin panel for adding courses, categorizing them, and uploading course images and videos. Customers can filter courses by category, purchase them via integrated payment systems (Stripe/PayPal), and access purchased courses through a "magic link" or direct video access.

The application uses Supabase for database management, authentication, and file storage, and includes features such as user authentication, payment history, and course reviews.
